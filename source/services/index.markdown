Since I have over decade of experience as web developer, mobile
developer and more generally software engineer I offer my expertise for
helping your project. I have significant experience of planning,
developing and optimising software projects in a wide range of
industries and technology sectors.

More specifically I have been working in the following areas.

- _Web applications:_ created webapps using various development stacks
  integrated with other systems through APIs.
- _Databases:_ built and optimized SQL storages based on MySQL, PostgreSQL
  as well as NoSQL solutions.
- _Distributed systems:_ implemented multipart scalable projects that 
  require efficient networking.
- _Cloud deployments:_ built systems based on different IaaS providers.
- _Mobile development:_ created applications for Apple devices integrated
  with server side through custom APIs.

In my opinion previous experience is important for reaching success in
the further work but more import is ability to step outside of the
existing circle to "unknown". This is a point where real engineering job
happens and as a result we have new solution, better performance,
improved scalability (depending on the goal). Such thing is possible if
engineer do not apply experience directly but apply universal principles
learnt from previous study, projects and problems. This approach allows
easy and quick learning of new technologies, programming languages,
protocols and allows define what is more effective for current
project/task.

That's it. If you are interested in my consulting or development services,
