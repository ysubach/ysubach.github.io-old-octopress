My name is Yuri Subach, I am seasoned web application developer and
system engineer. I live with my family in Podgorica, Montenegro.
We've moved here from our home town Barnaul in Russia just before New
Year 2013, now we enjoy hot climate and nearby sea and mountains.

This is my personal blog dedicated to professional part of my life. Here
I publish various thoughts, tips or just share my daily work experience.
Major publication topics include web developerment, web applications
performance, distributed systems, high load systems; general Linux
administration, cloud deployment and usage.
Another set of topics interesting for me is OS X daily usage 
and developement for iPhone/iPad.

Currently I
work as Senior Software Engineer at [Keycafe, Inc.](http://keycafe.com)

provide consulting and development [services](/services)
