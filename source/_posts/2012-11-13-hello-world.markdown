This is standard blog welcome message.

Just testing how [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org) blogging tool
works. It's really unusual to use `rake` for adding new posts, `vim` for
editing with `markdown` syntax and use `git` for pushing changes to
repository. If you see this post on my web site, then it means all these
components worked fine and first post is deployed.

In the future I'll possibly write more details about my blogging
experience with Octopress.
